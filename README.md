## ✨ Features

✅ Predict whether an employee is likely to **stay or leave**.
✅ Input 8 important parameters for prediction:

* Age
* Monthly Income
* Job Role
* OverTime
* Distance From Home
* Job Satisfaction
* Work Life Balance
* Total Working Years

✅ Visual outputs:

* **Donut chart** showing attrition probability.
* **Feature importance bar chart** to explain model insights.
* **Top 3 influencing factors** with explanations for HR decision-making.
  ✅ Clean and professional dashboard for HR analytics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Employee-Attrition-Prediction.git
cd Employee-Attrition-Prediction
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Train the model** (optional if `model.pkl` is already available)

```bash
python train_model.py
```

4. **Run the Flask app**

```bash
python app.py
```

5. **Open in browser**
